			<p>Music can help us keep in touch with our feelings especially in times where we have to deal with stress and problems but have limited interactions with others. So, if you ever have a hard time looking for the music that truly fits your mood and music taste, don't worry. Our website, first.fm, is built to provide users with artist, song, album, and genre recommendations depending on what they select on the website.<br></p><p> As a user attempts to use the website, the choice of an artist, song, or album recommendation would be displayed. Once they choose their desired recommendation, they would be presented with certain questions for the website to be able to gauge what artist/album/song/genre would match their taste by referring to their answers to the questions given. After this  process, the user would be given the recommendation of their choice! </p>	</div>
